        "note": "Did you know Buena Vista is home to one of the premier river surfing destinations in the country? Running right through the South Main neighborhood, the Arkansas River features several man-made \"standing waves\" that flow year-round.\nThe Staircase Wave: The most famous surf spot in town! Located just steps from the South Main Town Square, you can watch local surfers carve the \"infinite wave\" from the overlooks or the riverside beach.\nThe Downtown Wave: Known as \"Little Waikiki,\" this mellow wave sits directly in front of the Surf Hotel. It’s the perfect place to grab a drink at Wesley & Rose and watch the action from the patio.\nWant to try it? If you're feeling brave, you can rent river surfboards, wetsuits, and helmets at CKS Main Street or book a beginner lesson with the Rocky Mountain Outdoor Center (RMOC).",

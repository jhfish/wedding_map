Located just steps from the South Main Town Square, you can watch local surfers carve the \"infinite wave\" from the overlooks or the riverside beach.\nThe Downtown Wave: Known as \"Little Waikiki,\" this mellow wave sits directly in front of the Surf Hotel. It’s the perfect place to grab a drink at Wesley & Rose and watch the action from the patio.\nWant to try it? If you're feeling brave, you can rent river surfboards, wetsuits, and helmets at CKS Main Street or book a beginner lesson with the Rocky Mountain Outdoor Center (RMOC).",
